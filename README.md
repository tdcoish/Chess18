Chess18

Very first repository on Github. Since these are finished projects I'm not sure whether to upload the entire, potentially messy, project folder, or just some bits and pieces to highlight the important parts. 

Anyway, this project is from a few years ago, before I had any formal training at all. The purpose of the project is to generate valid chess starting positions, with randomized bishops, knights, and queens. Each player is guaranteed of having one dark and one light squared bishop, and the rooks and kings stay in the same positions as classical chess. I have to say, I was incredibly impressed with the stb image library, which made this project possible.

To see the actual code, navigate to the New Chess folder, and click on the NewChessMain.cpp file.
